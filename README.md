Elliptic Curve gmplib implementation of scalar point multiplication

entirely based on the code by Kuldeep Bhardwaj and Sanjay Chaudhary
* http://researchtrend.net/ijet32/6%20KULDEEP%20BHARDWAJ.pdf

GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library
* https://gmplib.org

program sets curve domain parameters, an integer and a G base point

perform point multiplication by scalar, computing the derived point

cryptographically speaking verifies private/public math correlation
